# Amazon Clone Project

Welcome to the Amazon Clone project! This project aims to replicate the core features and functionalities of the Amazon e-commerce platform using ReactJS, ReactQuery, and various modern frontend technologies. In this README, we'll outline the ideation, planning, and execution process of building this project.

## Ideation and Planning

### Features Breakdown

To start, we'll use draw.io or any diagramming tool to plan out the features and pages of our Amazon clone. Here's a breakdown of some key features:

1. **Homepage**: Displays popular products, deals, and promotions.
2. **Product Listing**: Displays a list of products with filtering and sorting options.
3. **Product Details**: Detailed view of a single product with images, description, reviews, and related products.
4. **User Authentication**: Sign up, sign in, and sign out functionalities.
5. **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and update items in the cart.
6. **Checkout**: Enter shipping details, select payment method, and place orders.
7. **Order History**: View past orders and their status.

### Component Structure

We'll structure the project into reusable components to maintain a clean and scalable codebase. Components such as Navbar, ProductCard, ProductDetails, Cart, and Checkout will be created and reused throughout the application.

### Design Planning

Before diving into development, we'll plan out the design aspects including:

- Text styles and fonts
- Color palette
- Component designs and layouts

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- ReactQuery: For data fetching and caching.
- Vite: Build tooling for modern web development.
- Redux: For managing global state (optional).
- Redux Thunk: Middleware for asynchronous actions (optional).
- Redux Toolkit: Utility functions to simplify Redux logic (optional).
- Context API: For managing local component state.
- Hooks: For functional components to manage state and lifecycle.
- Custom Hooks: To encapsulate reusable logic.
- Memoization: Optimization techniques using `memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.
- TypeScript: Although not used in this project, it's worth mentioning for future considerations.
